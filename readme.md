## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### How to use it?

Click on `Use this template` button to generate a new repository based on this starter kit. After that clone it to your computer, go to the project directory in console and type `npm install`.

### Available scripts

`npm run start` - runs development mode

`npm run build` - runs build process for production

`npm run publish` - runs build process and publish the page using `gh-pages` branch

### Continued development

I want to improve my skills. I'll do a few more challenges from Frontend Mentor, and I want to learn some new stuff like CSS and JS frameworks. Maybe in the future I'll go to full stack dev.
